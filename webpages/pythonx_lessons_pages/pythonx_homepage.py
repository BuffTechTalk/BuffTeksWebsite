        """:blush: Computer programming is the art of designing and creating instructions for computers to follow and execute in the form of software programs. It involves using programming languages, algorithms, and data structures to solve problems and accomplish tasks. With the advancement of technology, programming has expanded beyond traditional computer platforms to include smartphones, smartwatches, and even automobiles. It has also become a powerful tool in other fields such as chemistry, biology, finance, and more. 
        \nIn this tutorial, we aim to introduce the basics of Python programming and demonstrate its utility across various fields. Our goal is not to make you an expert software developer or engineer, but rather to equip you with fundamental Python programming skills that can enhance your work in your chosen field. That's why we've named this tutorial \"PythonX\" where 'X' represents the infinite possibilities and diverse applications in various domains."""
