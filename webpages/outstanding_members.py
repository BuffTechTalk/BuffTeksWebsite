It gave me the opportunity to apply the skills I’ve learned in class to real-world problems and work alongside others to develop effective software solutions. Through this, I gained hands-on experience with skills that are difficult to practice on your own._
            
    #         _Some key areas of growth include working with other developers on the same project, managing tasks and branches to avoid conflicting changes, and testing and reviewing pull requests to ensure high-quality merges. I also learned how to collaborate with team members to choose the best technologies for each project and pitch a piece of software using a prototype to stakeholders._
            
    #         _The problems I faced throughout the project ranged from finding solutions to everyday inconveniences like finding parking, to developing software for community support. This gave me practice in every phase of developing software from early research and planning, to designing the structure of the application, to building the application, to further refinement and improvement on the application. Overall, it’s been a great experience that I’d recommend to anyone wanting to get into software development or similar fields after graduation._"
