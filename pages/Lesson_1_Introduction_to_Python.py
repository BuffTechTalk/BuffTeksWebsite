        The following chat outlines the basic logic of computer programming. We start with a task that we want the computer to help complete.

        - **Step 1**: The programmer **analyzes reuqirements** to identify the process to complete the task.
        - **Step 2**: The programmer **implements** the identified process in programming code as a computer program.
        - **Step 3**: The programmer **deploys** the program on the computer and let the complete complete the task and give expected outcomes.

        This is a simplified outline of coding (computer programming), and additional steps may be involved depending on the task's complexity and the program.
